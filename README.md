# SMS-Email_Spam_Detector
📩 SMS & Email Spam Detector 🚀
Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based Spam Detector that classifies SMS messages and emails as spam or ham (not spam). Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Scikit-learn, the model analyzes text patterns to effectively filter out spam messages.

Features
✅ Detects spam in SMS messages & emails
✅ Preprocesses text using NLP techniques (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
✅ Uses TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
✅ Trained on a dataset with Naïve Bayes classification
✅ User-friendly interface for prediction

Tech Stack
🔹 Python
🔹 NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
🔹 Scikit-learn
🔹 Pandas & NumPy
🔹 Flask (if deployed as a web app)

How It Works
1️⃣ Loads and preprocesses the dataset
2️⃣ Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF
3️⃣ Trains a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier
4️⃣ Predicts whether a given message is Spam or Ham
5️⃣ Provides an easy-to-use interface for testing new messages
